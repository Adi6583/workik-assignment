Assignment on Simple Currency Conversion [Submitted on 18-SEPT-2023]


Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This means that we can use the same skills and tools that we use to build web applications to build desktop applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

To build an Electron desktop application, we will create a regular HTML file, CSS file, and JavaScript file. We will also need to create a main JavaScript file that will create a browser window and load  HTML file.

Once we have created  Electron desktop application, we can package it into an executable file that can be installed on other computers.

Here is a simple summary of the steps involved in building an Electron desktop application:

Create a new directory of project.
Install the Electron framework
Create HTML CSS JS files etc
